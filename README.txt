# yahtzee
An improper simulator of the game Yahtzee

If you don't know what Yahtzee is, it's a game involving 5 dice.
In this improper version of the game, you roll each of these 5 dice until you get all 5 dice with the same number on them all.

It's quite time-consuming, because you have a 1 out of 1,296 chance of actually getting a Yahtzee (getting a Yahtzee means you get all five dice with the same number), but you'll get there in the end.
